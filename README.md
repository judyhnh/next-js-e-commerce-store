## ▶ Setup instructions

- Clone the repository with `git clone <repo>`
- Setup the database by downloading and installing PostgreSQL
- Create a user and a database
- Create a new file `.env`
- Copy the environment variables from `.env-example` into `.env`
- Replace the placeholders xxxxx with your username, password and name of database
- Install dotenv-cli with `yarn add dotenv-cli`
- Run `yarn install` in your command line
- Run the migrations with `yarn migrate up`
- Start the server by running `yarn dev`

## ▶ Deploy on Fly.io
- Sign up on `Fly.io`
- On the `Fly.io Tokens page`, generate a new Fly.io access token named GitHub Actions Deploy Token and copy it from the text box that appears - **it will only be shown once**
- In your GitHub repo under `Settings → Secrets → Actions`, click the New repository secret button at the top right of the page and create a new token with the name FLY_API_TOKEN and the token you copied as the secret
- On the command line, log in to Fly.io using the following command and enter your credentials in the browser window that appears:
```
flyctl auth login
```
- Create an app, specifying the name using only lowercase letters and dashes:
flyctl apps create --name <app name>
- Create the Fly.io config files as demonstrated in the lecture (also available in the Next.js example repo)
- Change your database/connect.ts as in the lecture: only run config() from dotenv-safe if the FLY_IO environment variable is not set
- Change your next.config.js as in the lecture: disable linting and type checking on build, since we do this earlier in the GitHub Actions deploy process
- Add database credentials using Fly.io secrets (the credentials will be randomly generated for security):
